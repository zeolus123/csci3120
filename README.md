<h1>csci3120</h1>
for the three assignments for my operating systems class.

<h3>assignment1: pid manager</h3>
<p>in this assignment I implemented a very basic process id number manager, it allocates a bitmap like datastructure and allocates process id's as needed. I then designed a very basic multi-threaded test harness to test it. to run this application simply run "make all" to get the executable, then run "./testpid"</p>
